# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
1. Real-world objects contain <b>state</b> and <b>behavior</b>.
2. A software object's state is stored in <b>fields</b>.
3. A software object's behavior is exposed through <b>methods</b>.
4. Hiding internal data from the outside world, and accessing it only through publicly exposed methods is known as data <b>encapsulation</b>.
5. A blueprint for a software object is called a <b>class</b>.
6. Common behavior can be defined in a superclass and inherited into a subclass using the <b>extends</b> keyword.
7. A collection of methods with no implementation is called an <b>interface</b>.
8. A namespace that organizes classes and interfaces by functionality is called a <b>package</b>.
9. The term API stands for <b>Application Programming Interface</b>.

# Language Basics
## Variables
1. The term "instance variable" is another name for <b>non-static field</b>.
2. The term "class variable" is another name for <b>static field</b>.
3. A local variable stores temporary state; it is declared inside a <b>method</b>.
4. A variable declared within the opening and closing parenthesis of a method is called a <b>parameter</b>.
5. What are the eight primitive data types supported by the Java programming language? <b>byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char</b>
6. Character strings are represented by the class <b>java.lang.String</b>.
7. An <b>array</b> is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
