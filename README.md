# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
1. Real-world objects contain <b>state</b> and <b>behavior</b>.
2. A software object's state is stored in <b>fields</b>.
3. A software object's behavior is exposed through <b>methods</b>.
4. Hiding internal data from the outside world, and accessing it only through publicly exposed methods is known as data <b>encapsulation</b>.
5. A blueprint for a software object is called a <b>class</b>.
6. Common behavior can be defined in a superclass and inherited into a subclass using the <b>extends</b> keyword.
7. A collection of methods with no implementation is called an <b>interface</b>.
8. A namespace that organizes classes and interfaces by functionality is called a <b>package</b>.
9. The term API stands for <b>Application Programming Interface</b>.
